<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Since the days of analog computers built on cams and gears,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>
we’ve been engineering systems around the flow of data and the
critical calculations we must perform.</p>
<p>While the philosophy of our designs has remained consistent, our
engineering constraints are constantly evolving. In the past five years
we’ve seen the emergence of “big data,” or the ability to use commodity
infrastructure to analyze very large data sets in a batch. We’re
currently in the midst of a significant step forward in the tools,
methods, and technologies available for working with realtime streams of
data.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/01.svg" alt="The sheer amount of data in realtime streams can overwhelmconventional batch analysis architecture"><figcaption>The sheer amount of data in realtime streams can overwhelm

<h5 id="figure-1.-the-sheer-amount-of-data-in-realtime-streams-can-overwhelm-conventional-batch-analysis-architecture">Figure 1. The sheer amount of data in realtime streams can overwhelm conventional batch analysis architecture</h5>
<p>The amount of time, memory, and computation required to do even simple
operations on very large data sets can be extraordinary. In this report,
we explore <em>probabilistic methods for realtime stream analysis</em>. These
methods allow for quick and efficient calculations that approximate the
results that form a batch analysis.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/02.svg" alt="The Tricorder — powered by probabilistic methods?"><figcaption>The Tricorder — powered by probabilistic methods?</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-2.-the-tricorder-%E2%80%94-powered-by-probabilistic-methods%3F">Figure 2. The Tricorder — powered by probabilistic methods?</h5>
<p>It may sound like science fiction to be able to perform a task like
calculating the percentage overlap between two sets of billions of items
not only in milliseconds, but also with megabytes of memory. This
ability will not only reduce computers’ resource needs while solving
problems on big data, but it will also allow smaller devices to use more
advanced algorithms. Tricorders from <em>Star Trek</em>, for example, work with
complex algorithms running directly on a small device with hundreds of
sensors — all this in order to answer people’s questions, in real time,
to make them smarter. The key to this is understanding not only the
computational and memory bounds of our algorithms, but also the bounds
to their accuracy that are needed.</p>
<p>A probabilistic approach to algorithms realizes that it is not scalable
to simply continually add more computational power to a system — at some
point, adding more power will give diminished returns. Instead, we must
find a way to make our algorithms better, which in many cases means
rephrasing the questions we are asking and accepting approximations. In
return for this compromise, we can answer incredibly complex questions
and only use a fraction of the resources we would have otherwise needed.</p>

<h5 id="figure-3.-probabilistic-methods-create-a-summary-of-the-data-as-it-comes-in%2C-allowing-them-to-run-faster-and-more-efficiently">Figure 3. Probabilistic methods create a summary of the data as it comes in, allowing them to run faster and more efficiently</h5>
<p>Why would we accept a calculation that isn’t entirely precise? Because
it’s much, much faster! In our prototype, <em>CliqueStream</em>, we are able to
compare many very large sets in seconds when classically this
calculation would take dozens of minutes. Furthermore, although there is
<em>some</em> error to our calculations, it is bounded to 1.7%, which is more
than enough accuracy to understand the trends and signals and make
actionable decisions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a problem like finding the similarity between all pairs of
items in a large set is not well adapted for many batch frameworks that
are currently in use. For example, Hadoop takes advantage of the
map-reduce paradigm of computing, where computation is brought to data
in order to split up and speed up tasks. However, given a long list of
items, when asking how all pairs of items compare to each other we no
longer have data locality, and any Hadoop-based solution will be working
hard against its core philosophy in order to proceed with the
calculation. It is simply the wrong tool for the job.</p>
<p>Realtime systems require a different approach to engineering than static
systems. Generally, designers start with offline research on data to
develop and validate the model that they wish to use. Once the engineers
have a good understanding of the model, they build the realtime system.
Finally, it is deployed and quality is monitored. Probabilistic
algorithms are an added set of tools to aid in the construction of these
realtime systems for when complex calculations must be done but time and
resources are a constraint.</p>
<p>These systems offer a competitive edge. In essence, they bring you
knowledge about the future faster than anyone else could possibly have
computed it. Furthermore, they allow for these calculations to be done
closer to the user. Because of their low resource and computational
needs, calculations can be done client-side (even on a user’s phone), as
opposed to first having to transmit potentially bulky data back and
forth to a cluster or cloud service before it is analyzed.</p>
<p>This changes our interaction with data and computation — instead of
interacting with an all-knowing cloud that is predesigned to solve a
specific set of questions, we can own and understand the data ourselves
with algorithms powerful enough to answer a wider range of questions in
a more timely manner. This is more of a “fog” of computing, where
potential insights surround us and can be gleaned at any time. In this
paradigm, instead of data being moved to servers powerful enough to run
an algorithm, the algorithm itself is moved to the data source to answer
questions as they are asked.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p>Stream processing with probabilistic algorithms has a strong and quiet
history in industry. The main advantage of probabilistic algorithms is
their ability to do classic calculations with much less computational
and memory resources than traditional methods. As a result, many of the
applications listed below are indeed things that we could previously
have calculated. However, the difference now is the speed at which we
can do these calculations.</p>
<p>Further, these possible speed increases are orders of magnitude faster
than current standard techniques. This isn’t just a small improvement,
but a massive innovation.</p>
<p>Imagine we have a thermometer that issues a temperature reading every
.05 seconds. To calculate the average temperature in a batch system, we
would take an hour’s worth of data, or 72,000 data points. We would add
them all up and then divide by the number of data points. We might run
this calculation each minute.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/04.svg" alt="A batch method would store each temperature reading in a database thatcalcuations can be performed upon"><figcaption>A batch method would store each temperature reading in a database that
calcuations can be performed upon</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-1.-a-batch-system-would-store-each-temperature-reading-in-a-database-that-calcuations-can-be-performed-upon">Figure 1. A batch system would store each temperature reading in a database that calcuations can be performed upon</h5>
<p>In a probabilistic realtime system, we can only examine each data item
in the stream once. As a result, we could choose one of many possible
algorithms that either take a subsample of the data or find a way to
create a synopsis of the data that can be used later for better
analysis.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/05.svg" alt="A probabilistic system performs the calculations as the data comes in,storing only a synopsis"><figcaption>A probabilistic system performs the calculations as the data comes in,
storing only a synopsis</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-2.-a-probabilistic-system-performs-the-calculations-as-the-data-comes-in%2C-storing-only-a-synopsis-of-the-data">Figure 2. A probabilistic system performs the calculations as the data comes in, storing only a synopsis of the data</h5>
<p>One possible realtime approach is to choose a number of sample values,
say 10, and then replace those values with decreasing likelihood over
time. An average can be calculated from those 10 values at any given
time and is very likely to reflect the average temperature over the time
the calculation has been running (this is called reservoir sampling).
Another possible solution is to use a decaying distributional database
(such as forgettable, described in
<a href="#keyword-usage" class="doc_link">Keyword Usage</a>) to maintain a
small representation of the current distribution of temperatures. In
this way we can infer not only a view of the average, but also other
higher-order statistics.</p>
<p>In the batch example, we’d be using significant computational resources
on an ongoing basis, not to mention storing a complete hour’s worth of
data. In the realtime example, we store only 10 data points, and the
computation is orders of magnitude cheaper.</p>
<p>In addition, being online algorithms, there is a fundamental difference
in how the algorithms generate results — while batch algorithms only
have a result when they are done processing, online algorithms maintain
an internal state that is constantly updating with the most recent
results. This provides excellent mechanics for these algorithms to be
incorporated into data streams and any sort of realtime processing. We
can have a process that is responsible for reading the stream and
updating the internal state, while any other process can freely read the
internal state and see what the current results are. Moreover, in terms
of distributed data analysis, this separation between reading and
writing is incredibly important to building performant systems.</p>
<p>Practically, these orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance allow
us to run 10 or 100 times more computations for the same cost for
high-performance applications; or to run many experimental calculations;
or to even push computation onto cheap devices, which has wide
implications for mobile development and the emerging Internet of Things
(IoT).</p>
<p>In the following few sections we walk through specific examples of where
probabilistic techniques are being used today.</p>
<h3 id="trending-topics">Trending Topics</h3>
<p>Social networks see tons of data. This data is flowing in as a constant
stream of timestamped updates. For example, there are approximately six
thousand tweets posted to Twitter each second,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> and
that number will probably continue to increase. Despite this
volume of data, most networks offer a realtime view of the top
discussion topics that are currently popular with users of the service.
This is a tool for users to explore and discover the most interesting
and timely content.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/06.png" alt="Twitter and Facebook trending topics for a random day in January,2015"><figcaption>Twitter and Facebook trending topics for a random day in January,
2015</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-3.-twitter-and-facebook-trending-topics-for-a-random-day-in-january%2C-2015">Figure 3. Twitter and Facebook trending topics for a random day in January, 2015</h5>
<p>These calculations are not simply counts of words used or clicks on
links. If that were the case, Justin Bieber and Kim Kardashian would top
the lists all thetime.
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>
Instead, as messages enter the system, they are broken up into
phrases of various lengths, called <em>n-grams</em>. These phrases are then
monitored with a probabilistic calculation that represents the rate of
mentions of the phrases.</p>
<p>Machine learning loves odd vocabulary. Single words, or 1-grams, are
called “unigrams”; pairs of two words, or 2-grams, are called “bigrams”;
sets of three words, or 3-grams, are called “trigrams”; and larger sets,
such as 4-grams, are just pronounced as written (“four grams,” etc.).</p>
<p>Once we have a current rate and a history of all n-grams’ usage over
time, we can quantify how anomalous the current traffic is. When the
system sees a disproportionate rate of mentions of a phrase, it can
elevate that n-gram to be “trending.”</p>
<p>The remarkable thing about this system is that for any phrase in any
language, it can effectively answer the question, what is the current
rate of discussion? This massive calculation would be prohibitively
expensive and much too slow if done in a batch system.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/07.png" alt="A bursting phrase on social media"><figcaption>A bursting phrase on social media</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-4.-a-burst-of-activity-around-a-phrase-in-social-media">Figure 4. A burst of activity around a phrase in social media</h5>
<p>This method allows for a system that can monitor attention to tens of
millions of phrases efficiently and in real time.</p>
<p>Finally, some networks have human review before topics are presented
publicly to check that they are appropriate. This is a good idea
whenever data directly from the Internet is used in a consumer-facing
product.</p>
<h3 id="user-segmentation">User Segmentation</h3>
<figure><img src="figures/08.svg" alt="User segmentation"><figcaption>User segmentation</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-5.-user-are-segmented-into-different-groups-to-understand-their-behaviours">Figure 5. User are segmented into different groups to understand their behaviours</h5>
<p>When operating large websites, it is often important to understand the
various types of people that are visiting your pages. This can become
quite a task when there are millions of people visiting the website
daily and your content is constantly changing. You may be able to do the
required analysis overnight, but the result may be of less use the next
day; you want to know the types of people visiting the page right now.</p>
<p>This problem highlights the difference between <em>online</em> and <em>offline</em>
clustering methods. User segmentation is often done by selecting a group
of features from the users’ sessions (for example, the titles or tags of
the pages they have gone to and the paths through the website they have
taken) and seeing if there are any groups of users who share similar
actions. Each of these groups will be considered one cluster and
represent one type of user behavior.</p>
<p>One problem, however, is that as the content on your pages changes, so
too will the actions of your users. In fact, you could put up a new page
that attracts a completely different group of people you have never seen
before! It is very useful to be able to understand this right away and
see how the changes you make to the content of your website change user
behavior in real time.</p>
<p>In a realtime system, we can run an online clustering algorithm which is
able to cluster users into distinct populations. As more users perform
actions, the characteristics of these populations will change and so
will the characterisations given by the clustering algorithm. This
allows us to query the algorithm at any point to see if two users are in
the same population and how many users are within each group.</p>
<h3 id="database-precaching">Database Precaching</h3>
<p>Databases are storing more and more data, which at some point must be
stored on a disk or a cluster of disks. As these clusters grow in size,
the potential cost for reading from them will invariably increase as
well. Some databases try to mitigate this latency through various
indexing schemes. An index is a compressed representation of the data
with pointers to where you can find the full values.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/09.svg" alt="Database precaching"><figcaption>Database precaching</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-6.-a-quick-precaching-mechanism-reduces-the-number-of-requests-to-the-bulky-database">Figure 6. A quick precaching mechanism reduces the number of requests to the bulky database</h5>
<p>For example, riak <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>
will store a copy of the index in memory so that we know whether
the data even exists and where it is stored. This type of scheme is
necessary when we are dealing with potentially very high latency reads
from the actual database on disk — if we have a very quick way of first
figuring out whether the data exists we can make sure we only do the
very expensive disk reads when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The riak approach rapidly encounters a problem when the index requires
too much memory, however. This can happen very quickly when we want to
store many small items. In this case we will quickly fill up memory with
all of the keys we are trying to store, even though the actual values do
not come close to the storage capacity of our database cluster.</p>
<p>This sort of problem is perfectly suited for a probabilistic data
structure. Bloom filters are data structures with a fixed, small memory
footprint that store a set of objects and can be queried to see if
things are in that set of objects. This allows us to answer the
question: for any object, have we seen this object in the past? This
question can be answered with no false negatives and only false
positives. What this means is that, in the worst-case scenario, a bloom
filter will return an incorrect result and say that it has seen an
object before when it actually hasn’t (the converse can never happen — a
bloom filter will never say it hasn’t seen an object when it really
has). In addition, this error can be made incredibly low (in
<a href="#example-12.-size-estimates-for-the-number-of-unique-words-in-wikipedia"
class="doc_link">Example 12. Size estimates for the number of unique words in Wikipedia</a> we’ll see that we can
store 4,956,262 unique keys with 0.14% error using only 11.5 MB).</p>
<p>By using a bloom filter, we can very easily create a precache that
stores all of the keys in the database that we have seen before. If a
lookup is requested, we can quickly verify whether we have seen the data
before and, if we have, proceed with the expensive disk read. Since we
are using a probabilistic data structure for this problem, as opposed to
storing the full keyspace in memory, we can store an incredible amount
of keys in memory for incredibly fast access while not practically
limiting our database capacity to the amount of RAM available. For
example, if we wanted our bloom filter to only have a 0.1% error rate,
then we could store a representation of 556,421,600 items per gigabyte
of RAM (regardless of the actual item size). This is starkly more than
the 41,666,666 keys/GB we could store if we stored the raw keys
(assuming the keys were 24 characters long and there was no overhead).</p>
<p>This specific problem appears in many places even outside of databases.
In biology this approach is frequently used in protein folding problems
where backtracking algorithms are used. A small representation of some
work that was previously attempted and may have failed can be stored in
a probabilistic system so that in future iterations of the algorithm we
do not waste time attempting the calculation again. This is particularly
important since the actual models that are being worked on are very
complex — storing a small representation saves memory and the
probabilistic system saves computation so that the algorithm can focus
on the folding. This allows the system to perform very large, complex
operations and then store a compact representation of the results, which
is an efficient way to search through a large, complex space.</p>
<p>In general, whenever calculations are expensive but can be avoided if we
can identify whether they’ve been done before, these sorts of precaching
algorithms are indispensable.</p>
<h3 id="graph-databases">Graph Databases</h3>
<p>The growing interdependencies between systems and groups of people have
led to a major focus on graphs as an essential way of understanding the
dynamics of social and human networks. Graph techniques have been used
in a wide range of applications, from recommendation algorithms
(collaborative filtering and SPEAR) to search indexing (PageRank),
social networks (frontrunners, influence tracking), and
traffic/networking problems for both computer and physical
infrastructure (path detection).</p>
<p>In all of these cases, the amount of data we are tracking is large and
is only increasing. For example, in the past social networks used to
only change by thousands of connections per day, but now the changes can
easily be on the order of thousands per second! These systems are taking
in more and more data, and we still want to be able to do the same kinds
of complex analysis.</p>
<p>For graphs, one major hurdle in this shift to more data is how to
efficiently store the data on a cluster of servers. Not only are we
storing some value representing a node on the graph, but we must also
store connections to other nodes and hopefully be able to retrieve
neighboring nodes quickly when necessary. It is this need to constantly
be traversing the graph that makes storing graphs difficult. If we have
a distributed database and request a user’s data, as well as their
friends’ data, the more the information is spread across our cluster the
slower our request will be! This is because the most expensive factor in
retrieving data from a graph database is the latency in accessing the
different nodes in the cluster. It’s much better to make one query to
one node than incur large amounts of network overhead getting data from
many nodes.</p>
<p>This problem of how to place data in a distributed graph database is
called the <em>balanced graph partitioning problem</em>. We want to spread the
data onto as many machines and as equally as possible, while minimizing
the number of edges that span across machines. A realtime solution to
this problem will allow us to start storing truly massive datasets and
doing thorough analyses of them where it is currently simply impractical
to do so. Currently, most graph databases become impractical once the
dataset reaches billions of nodes with a comparable number of
relationships. The only remedy that is available is to use considerable
resources building customized solutions or using an off-the-shelf
solution which has far from optimal performance.</p>
<p>The balanced graph partitioning problem is an open and difficult
research problem. A solution to this problem will revolutionize the
state of data science.</p>
<p>While there have been many attempts to solve this problem, and there are
many promising methods out there, a current leading approach is based on
subtree kernels and being able to compare graphs to each other. This
problem is quite complex when calculated fully; however, probabilistic
methods have been devised that make a fingerprint of the structure of
the graph and allow for quick comparisons.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/10.svg" alt="Comparing graph similarity"><figcaption>Comparing graph similarity</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-7.-a-quick-and-robust-comparison-method-for-graphs-opens-up-completely-new-analysis-possibilities">Figure 7. A quick and robust comparison method for graphs opens up completely new analysis possibilities</h5>
<p>This method is not only useful as a potential solution to graph
partitioning, but also allows us to use graphs for many other
applications that were not possible before. We can run classifiers that
can classify graphs without having to hand-code features from them. For
example, we can compare the types of friend groups (represented as
graphs of people) of different people and classify the different
communities without having to manually decide what important features in
the graph should be considered in the classification. This makes any
resulting model much more robust and meaningful, since we can later
deduce what features the algorithm thought were important in the
classification.</p>
<h3 id="anomaly-detection">Anomaly Detection</h3>
<p>Anomaly detection is another common application. Anomaly detection is
akin to finding the needle in the haystack, while other applications
that we’ve discussed are more like understanding the nature of the
haystack.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>
Furthermore, we want to be able to not only find the needle, but
predict when we will next see it and what other haystacks will contain
similar needles. In finance, for example, it is critical to be able to
find, track, and predict any sort of possible anomalous situation.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/11.svg" alt="Anomaly detection"><figcaption>Anomaly detection</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-8.-anomaly-detection-can-alert-when-specific-trends-start-to-appear-and-help-correlate-multiple-signals-to-eachother">Figure 8. Anomaly detection can alert when specific trends start to appear and help correlate multiple signals to eachother</h5>
<p>This can become quite taxing computationally as the number of different
series of data you are tracking increases. Moreover, when it becomes
necessary to correlate different series with one another, the complexity
of the system goes through the roof.</p>
<p>Probabilistic data structures and general streaming data analysis can
help by filtering out which series possibly have anomalies in them and
doing a first-pass correlation in order to reduce the total workload.
Various hashing schemes like locality-sensitive hashing provide a quick
way to summarize data and find similar instances of it. Furthermore,
various methods using HyperLogLog as a first-pass filter have been
studied that are able to automatically find correlations within an
arbitrary stream of data.</p>
<h3 id="security-and-exploitation">Security and Exploitation</h3>
<p>In computer security, it is often hard to be able to identify a threat
before it becomes a danger. This is what makes maintaining the security
of a network difficult — while it is relatively easy to protect against
threats that have been seen before, you never know whether you have
already been targeted by new threats. In addition, even if you know the
fingerprint of a potential attack, it is often hard to sift through all
the requests happening on the network in order to identify it before it
is too late.</p>
<p>New measures in computer security focus on identifying trends and
patterns in normal service usage and being able to quickly identify when
users deviate from the norm. This helps security teams recognize traffic
that may represent attack vectors into their systems.</p>
<p>Probabilistic algorithms that are able to summarize the complex traffic
pattern of a user — potentially spanning months of service usage — are
incredibly important in this process. By being able to summarize these
usage patterns and perform similarity measurements on these
fingerprints, we are able to quickly spot when something anomalous is
happening. In addition, because we’re operating on summaries we can do
the calculation quickly and store much less data. This transforms a
complex analysis requiring special-purpose hardware into one involving
small algorithms that can practically run on routers or load balancers,
or concurrently with other services on a system. By being able to do
these calculations quickly, we can recognize and prevent intrusions.
This will help thwart attacks before they complete instead of
identifying them after the fact.</p>
<p>For example, a port scan is when a malicious (or curious) machine
attempts many connections to a target server over the network.
Algorithms such as thresholded random walks have shown promise at
detecting port scans, which have always been hard to monitor because of
the low signal-to-noise ratio (for each malicious connection by a port
scan there could be thousands of normal connections) and the sheer
sophistication of the methods used. With the use of online and
probabilistic methods, it is possible to quickly (both computationally
and in terms of the number of samples needed) detect port scans with a
very low incidence of false negatives.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>
<p>In this section we present a technical introduction to stream analysis
with online algorithms and probabilistic data structures. Then we dive
deep into a small selection of probabilistic data structures to give an
in-depth understanding of how they work. This understanding of the
fundamentals will give the reader a foothold for understanding most of
the other probabilistic algorithms in the wild. Finally, we will go
through two real-world examples in order to compare the selected data
structures.</p>
<p>The source code in this section is presented in the Python programming
language, which is commonly used for probabilistic applications and also
has the advantage of being easy to read.</p>
<p>This section provides a foundation for actionable decisions regarding
which structure to use in different applications.</p>
<h3 id="realtime-algorithm-primer">Realtime Algorithm Primer</h3>
<p>Realtime algorithms are generally characterized by being “online” or
“one-pass.” This means that the algorithm needs to see a particular
piece of data once, and only once, in order to maintain its calculation
and later give a response to whatever query the algorithm was designed
to answer. While these algorithms generally have a bit more mathematical
sophistication, the payoff is an enormous reduction in computation time
and memory footprint.</p>
<p>For example, let’s look at two similar algorithms for calculating the
variance of a series of numbers. The offline (batch) method would take
all of the data points, sum them, and then divide the sum by the total
number of data points in order to calculate the mean. Then, we would go
back and see how our data points deviated from this mean in order to
find the variance. If a new data point came in and we wanted to again
know the variance for our dataset, we would need to recalculate the mean
and then again go through and see how our data deviates from the new
mean.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an online algorithm that calculates the variance for
a stream of numbers always maintains the current sum of the data points,
how many data points have already been seen, and an auxiliary quantity,
<span class="monospaced">M2</span>, that relates to the variance. In
this case, whenever we want to know the variance of our dataset we
simply must divide the auxiliary quantity that we are maintaining by our
count of the number of items. These two quantities that the algorithm
keeps track of are called the <em>internal state</em> of the algorithm.</p>
<p>When looking at the complexity of an algorithm, we generally use Big-O
notation. In this notation we describe how many operations, in general,
the algorithm must perform for an input of length <span
class="monospaced">N</span>. For example, if our algorithm is <span
class="monospaced">O(N)</span>, if we double the amount of data then we
double the amount of work that must be done. For <span
class="monospaced">O(N^2)</span>, a doubling of the data is a
quadrupling of the amount of work needed. Ideally an algorithm is <span
class="monospaced">O(1)</span>, which means the algorithm does not
perform differently depending on how much data you give it — it will
always have the same performance.</p>
<p>Using these internal states, we are able to shift the computational
complexity of a query into the insertion. With the batch algorithm we
must do <span class="monospaced">O(1)</span> calculations to insert a
new item and <span class="monospaced">O(N)</span> to calculate the
average. On the other hand, for the online algorithm we must again do
<span class="monospaced">O(1)</span> for an insertion (albeit with a
larger constant factor), but only <span class="monospaced">O(1)</span>
to calculate the variance! Furthermore, we save on memory as well. For
the batch algorithm, we must store every data point we wish to use in
our calculation (<span class="monospaced">O(N)</span>); however, the
online algorithm only needs to store the two internal state variables
(<span class="monospaced">O(1)</span>).</p>
<h5 id="example-1.-batch-versus-online-variance">Example 1. Batch versus online variance</h5>

<h4 id="online-algorithms-for-streams">Online Algorithms for Streams</h4>
<p>When working with streaming data, having an online algorithm is
critical. It is <em>because</em> we can look at a piece of data once and then
throw it away that these algorithms are so attractive. As a result, the
computational complexity and memory use of these algorithms are very
strictly bounded and they are very well behaved. Batch algorithms, on
the other hand, have computational complexity and memory use that are
very dependent on the input dataset and can quickly make analysis
unfeasible with available hardware and time constraints.</p>
<p>Streams are characterized by a potentially unending sequence of data
that is constantly being fed to your algorithms. If your algorithm is
online, then the amount of memory required is simply the size of its
internal state. For most realtime algorithms (in particular for those
described below, except the scaling Bloom filter), the size of the
internal state is static and does not depend on how much data has been
seen before. That is to say, whether we have just turned on our
algorithm or it has been processing data for a month, it will still use
the same amount of resources and have the same performance
characteristics when processing a query.</p>
<p>Imagine a bucket that can hold any amount of water. That’s an online
algorithm. Now imagine a balloon, which expands to hold the amount of
water you put inside it. That’s an offline algorithm.</p>
<p>On the other hand, batch algorithms completely depend on how much data
they have seen. Many batch algorithms work perfectly well with small
amounts of test data but start to under perform when put into production
with realistic datasets. This is because as they see more data their
internal state grows, which means they not only need to store a larger
state but also must process more data every time they respond to a
query.</p>
<p>A common remedy for this is to only look at data from a fixed time
window (for example, only using the past week’s worth of data). However,
this is simply a band-aid for the problem: the algorithm will still do
just as poorly if the amount of data seen per day or the complexity of
the data increases.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>
Furthermore, these sorts of constraints to the input dataset are
often motivated simply by the resource usage of the algorithm and not
the actual desired insights from the results, which can result in
confusion or simply making the data useless. Most importantly, however,
this sort of grouping by time can easily skew statistics. For example,
if you were to group your data into hour long groupings, what would
happen if you shifted the groups by 30min? How would your insights
change if the grouping were changed to 1min instead? This problem stems
from the fact that these sorts of models have no optimal value for the
number or size of the groupings<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>
yet the results are completely dependent on this choice.</p>

<p>Probabilistic data structures allow us to make trade-offs in accuracy
for immense decreases in memory usage. They are a form of online
algorithm that performs a small calculation when data first arrives in
order to store a “synopsis” of what it has seen, so it is able to answer
queries. As a result, the number of operations we can do on these data
structures is much more restricted than when we have the full dataset in
a <span class="monospaced">set</span> or a trie. However, with a single
HyperLogLog++ structure using 2.56 KB of memory we can count the number
of unique items up to approximately 7,900,000,000 items with 1.625%
error.</p>
<p>This means that if we were trying to count the number of unique license
plate numbers for cars, if our HyperLogLog++ counter said there were
654,192,028, we would be confident that the actual number lies between
664,822,648 and 643,561,407. Furthermore, if this accuracy is not
sufficient, we can simply add more memory to the structure and it will
perform better. Giving it 40.96 KB of resources will decrease the error
from 1.625% to 0.4%. If we had stored the full dataset this would have
taken 3.925 GB (and that is assuming no overhead!).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the HyperLogLog++ structure would only be able to
count license plates or compare with another collection to see how many
license plates the two structures had in common or how many were
different. So, for example, we could have one structure for every state
in order to find how many unique license plates are in those states. We
could then merge them all to get a count for the whole country. However,
given a license plate we couldn’t tell you if we’ve seen it before with
very good accuracy, and we couldn’t give you a sample of the actual
license plate numbers we have already seen. If those were the important
questions to ask, we would choose another probabilistic data structure
(for example, a Bloom filter) instead.</p>
<p>Probabilistic data structures are fantastic when you have taken the time
to understand the problem you are trying to solve and need to put
something into production that can answer a very small set of questions
about a very large set of data. Each different structure has different
questions it can answer at different accuracies, so finding the right
one is just a matter of understanding your requirements.</p>
<p>In almost all cases, probabilistic data structures work by finding an
alternative representation for the data that is more compact and
contains the relevant information for answering a certain set of
questions. This can be thought of as a type of lossy compression, where
we may lose some aspects of the data but we retain the necessary
components. Since we are allowing the loss of data that isn’t
necessarily relevant for the particular set of questions we care about,
we can still answer the questions at hand while storing the minimal
amount of information. It is because of this that the choice of which
probabilistic data structure you will use is quite important — you want
to pick one that retains the right information for your use case!</p>
<p>Before we dive in, it should be made clear that all the “error rates”
here are defined in terms of standard deviations. This term comes from
describing Gaussian distributions and describes how spread out a
function is around a center value. When the standard deviation grows, so
do the number of values further away from the center point. Error rates
for probabilistic data structures are framed this way because all the
analyses around them are probabilistic. So, for example, when we say
that the HyperLogLog algorithm has an error of err =
\( \frac{1.04}{\sqrt{m}} \) we mean that 66% of the time the error will be
smaller than <span class="monospaced">err</span>, 95% of the time it
will be below <span class="monospaced">2*err</span>, and 99.7% of the
time it will be below <span class="monospaced">3*err</span>.

<h4 id="very-approximate-counting-with-a-1-byte-morris-counter">Very Approximate Counting with a 1-byte Morris Counter</h4>
<p>We’ll introduce the topic of probabilistic counting with one of the
earliest probabilistic counters, the Morris counter (by Robert Morris of
the NSA and Bell Labs). Applications include counting millions of
objects in a restricted-RAM environment (e.g., on an embedded computer),
understanding large data streams, and problems in AI like image and
speech recognition.</p>
<p>The Morris counter keeps track of an exponent and models the counted
state as \( 2^{exponent} \) (rather than a correct count) — it provides an
order of magnitude estimate. This estimate is updated using a
probabilistic rule.</p>
<p>We start with our state, an exponent, set to 0. If we ask for the
“value” of the counter, we’ll be given <span
class="monospaced">pow(2,exponent) = 1</span> (the keen reader will note
that this is off by one — we did say this was an <em>approximate</em>
counter!). If we ask the counter to increment itself it will generate a
random number (using the uniform distribution) and test if <span
class="monospaced">random(0, 1) &lt;= 1/pow(2,exponent)</span>. For
<span class="monospaced">exponent == 0</span> this will always be true
and the counter will increment, setting the exponent to 1.</p>
<p>The second time we ask the counter to increment itself it will test if
<span class="monospaced">random(0, 1) &lt;= 1/pow(2,1)</span>. This will
be true 50% of the time. If the test passes, then the exponent is
incremented. If not, then the exponent is not incremented for this
increment request.</p>
<p>The table below shows the likelihoods of an increment occurring for each
of the first exponents.</p>

<p>The maximum we could approximately count where we use a single unsigned
byte for the exponent is <span class="monospaced">math.pow(2,255) ==
5e76</span>. The error relative to the actual count will be fairly large
as the counts increase, but the RAM saving is tremendous as we only use
1 byte rather than the 32 unsigned bytes we’d otherwise have to use. In
the 1970s, when this scheme was devised, this saving of 31 bytes was
tremendous and allowed for previously unimaginable calculations to be
done.</p>

<h4 id="k-min-values">K-Min Values</h4>
<p>When comparing sets is critical — for example, when creating similarity
graphs showing connectivity between different communities (such as in
the prototype, CliqueStream) or comparing user trends — K-Min Values is
the perfect data structure to use.</p>
<p>In the Morris counter, we lose any sort of information about the items
we insert. That is to say, the counter’s internal state is the same
whether we do <span class="monospaced">.add(“alice”)</span> or <span
class="monospaced">.add(“bob”)</span>. This extra information is useful
and, if used properly, could help us have our counters only count unique
items. In this way, calling <span
class="monospaced">.add(“alice”)</span> thousands of times would only
increase the counter once.</p>
<p>To enable this, we will exploit properties of hashing functions. These
functions can be any arbitrary method that takes in an input and assigns
a numerical value to it. These values do not need to be unique (in fact,
these “collisions” account for most of the error in probabilistic data
structures), however they should be repeatable. That is to say, I should
get the same result for the same input. However, the main property we
would like to take advantage of is the fact that the hash function takes
input and <em>uniformly</em> distributes it. For example, let’s assume we have
a hash function that takes in a string and outputs a number between 0
and 1. For that function to be uniform means that when we feed it in a
string we are equally likely to get a value of 0.5 as a value of 0.2, or
any other value. This also means that if we feed it in many string
values, we would expect the values to be relatively evenly spaced.
Remember, this is a probabilistic argument: they won’t always be evenly
spaced, but if we have many strings and try this experiment many times,
they will tend to be evenly spaced.</p>
<p>Suppose we took 100 items and stored the hashes of those values (the
hashes being numbers from 0-1). Knowing the spacing is even means that
instead of saying, “We have 100 items,” we could say, “We have a
distance of 0.01 between every item.” This is where the K-Min Values
algorithm
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup>
finally comes in — if we keep the <span
class="monospaced">k</span> smallest unique hash values we have seen, we
can approximate the overall spacing between hash values and infer what
the total number of items is.</p>
<p>In <a href="#figure-2.-the-values-stored-in-a-k-min-values-structure-as-more-elements-are-added"
class="doc_link">Figure 2. The values stored in a K-Min Values structure as more elements are added</a>
we can see the state of a
K-Min Values structure (also called a KMV) as more and more items are
added. At first, since we don’t have many hash values, the largest hash
we have kept is quite large. As we add more and more, the largest of the
<span class="monospaced">k</span> hash values we have kept gets smaller
and smaller. Using this method, we can get error rates of
O\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi(k-2)}}\right).</p>
<figure><img src="figures/13.svg" alt="Density of hash space for K-Min Values structures"><figcaption>Density of hash space for K-Min Values structures</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-2.-the-values-stored-in-a-k-min-values-structure-as-more-elements-are-added">Figure 2. The values stored in a K-Min Values structure as more elements are added</h5>
<p>This is similar to estimating the number of people in a room by looking
at how much space a smaller portion of the group takes up. If we assume
that people want to be as spaced out as possible (the property we get
from the uniformity of our hash function), then the amount of space
<span class="monospaced">k</span> people use indicates the total number
of people. For example, if we have a room with a size of 1,000 square
feet (sf) and we know that a group of 10 people in the room are taking
up 20 sf, then we can estimate there are 500 people in the room!</p>
<p>The larger <span class="monospaced">k</span> is, the more we can account
for the hashing function we are using not being completely uniform for
our particular input, and for unfortunate hash values. An example of
unfortunate hash values would be hashing <span class="monospaced">[“A”,
“B”, “C”]</span> and getting the values <span
class="monospaced">[0.01, 0.02, 0.03]</span>. If we start hashing more
and more values, it is less and less probable that they will clump up.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since we are only keeping the smallest <em>unique</em> hash
values, the data structure only considers unique inputs. We can see this
easily because if we are in a state where we only store the smallest
three hashes and currently <span class="monospaced">[0.1, 0.2,
0.3]</span> are the smallest hash values, if we add in something with
the hash value of <span class="monospaced">0.4</span> our state will not
change. Similarly, if we add more items with a hash value of <span
class="monospaced">0.3</span>, our state will also not change. This is a
property called <em>idempotence</em>; it means that if we do the same operation
with the same inputs multiple times, the state will not be changed. This
is in contrast to, for example, an <span
class="monospaced">append</span> on a list, which will always change its
value. This concept of idempotence carries on to all of the data
structures in this section except for the Morris counter.</p>

interchangeably (the word “cardinality” is from set theory and is used
more in the analysis of probabilistic data structures). Here, we can see

cardinality of many set operations with relatively low error:</p>

<h4 id="bloom-filters">Bloom Filters</h4>
<figure><img src="figures/14.svg" alt="Bloom filter"><figcaption>Bloom filter</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-3.-bloom-filter">Figure 3. Bloom filter</h5>
<p>Bloom filters excel at easily distinguishing if a particular item has
been seen before. In addition, advanced versions of the algorithms give
extra features like scalability and time windowing. This can be useful
when making a caching layer or when simply asking whether you have seen
a particular user within a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to be able to do other types of set operations, for
which we need to introduce new types of probabilistic data structures.
Bloom filters
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup>
were created to answer the question of whether we’ve seen an
item before.</p>
<p>Bloom filters work by having multiple hash values in order to represent
a value as multiple integers. If we later see something with the same
set of integers, we can be reasonably confident that it is the same
value.</p>
<p>In order to do this in a way that efficiently utilizes available
resources, we implicitly encode the integers as the indexes of a list.
This could be thought of as a list of <span
class="monospaced">bool</span> values that are initially set to <span
class="monospaced">False</span>. If we are asked to add an object with
hash values <span class="monospaced">[10, 4, 7]</span>, then we set
the tenth, fourth, and seventh indexes of the list to <span
class="monospaced">True</span>. In the future, if we are asked if we
have seen a particular item before, we simply find its hash values and
check if all the corresponding spots in the <span
class="monospaced">bool</span> list are set to <span
class="monospaced">True</span>.</p>
<p>This method gives us no false negatives and a controllable rate of false
positives. What this means is that if the Bloom filter says we have not
seen an item before, then we can be 100% sure that we haven’t seen the
item before. On the other hand, if the Bloom filter states that we
<em>have</em> seen an item before, then there is a probability that we actually
have not and we are simply seeing an erroneous result. This erroneous
result comes from the fact that we will have hash collisions, and
sometimes the hash values for two objects will be the same even if the
objects themselves are not the same. However, in practice Bloom filters
are set to have error rates below 0.5%, so this error can be acceptable.</p>
<p>We can simulate having as many hash functions as we want simply by
having two hash functions that are independent of each other. This
method is called “double hashing.” If we have a hash function that gives
us two independent hashes, we can do:</p>
<pre><code>def multi_hash(key, num_hashes):
    hash1, hash2 = hashfunction(key)
    for i in xrange(num_hashes):
        yield (hash1 + i * hash2) % (2^32 - 1)
</code></pre>
<p>The modulo ensures that the resulting hash values are 32 bit (we would
modulo by <span class="monospaced">2^64 - 1</span> for 64-bit hash
functions).</p>
<p>The exact length of the <span class="monospaced">bool</span> list and
the number of hash values per item we need will be fixed based on the
capacity and the error rate we require. With some reasonably simple
statistical arguments
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup>
we see that the ideal values are:</p>
<p>\begin{array}
{rcl} num\_bits &amp; = &amp; -capacity \cdot \frac{log(error)}{log(2)^2} \\
num\_hashes &amp; = &amp; num\_bits \cdot \frac{log(2)}{capacity}
\end{array}</p>
<p>That is to say, if we wish to store 50,000 objects (no matter how big
the objects themselves are) at a false positive rate of 0.05% (that is
to say, 0.05% of the times we say we have seen an object before, we
actually have not), it would require 791,015 bits (0.7Mb) of storage and
11 hash functions.</p>
<p>To further improve our efficiency in terms of memory use, we can use
single bits to represent the <span class="monospaced">bool</span> values
(a native <span class="monospaced">bool</span> actually takes 4 bits).
We can do this easily by using the <span
class="monospaced">bitarray</span> module.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>What happens if we insert more items than we specified for the capacity
of the Bloom filter? At the extreme end, all the items in the <span
class="monospaced">bool</span> list will be set to <span
class="monospaced">True</span>, in which case we say that we have seen
every item. This means that Bloom filters are very sensitive to what
their initial capacity was set to, which can be quite aggravating if we
are dealing with a set of data whose size is unknown (for example, a
stream of data).</p>
<p>One way of dealing with this is to use a variant of Bloom filters called
<em>scalable Bloom filters</em>.
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup>
They work by chaining together multiple Bloom filters whose
error rates vary in a specific way.
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup>
By doing this, we can guarantee an overall error rate and simply
add a new Bloom filter when we need more capacity. In order to check if
we’ve seen an item before, we simply iterate over all of the sub-Blooms
until either we find the object or we exhaust the list. A sample
implementation of this structure can be seen in
<a href="#example-6.-simple-scaling-bloom-filter-implementation"
class="doc_link">Example 6. Simple scaling Bloom filter implementation</a>, where we use the previous
Bloom filter implementation for the underlying functionality and have a
counter to simplify knowing when to add a new Bloom.</p>
<p>Another way of dealing with this is using a method called timing Bloom
filters.
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup>
This variant allows elements to be expired out of the data
structure, thus freeing up space for more elements. This is especially
nice for dealing with streams, since we can have elements expire after,
say, an hour and have the capacity be large enough to deal with the
amount of data we see per hour. Using a Bloom filter this way would give
us a nice view into what has been happening in the last hour.</p>

<p>We can also do unions with Bloom filters in order to join multiple sets
of items. One caveat with this is that you can only take the union of
two Blooms with the same capacity and error rate. Furthermore, the final
Bloom’s used capacity can be as high as the sum of the used capacities
of the two Blooms unioned to make it. What this means is that you could
start with two Bloom filters that are a little more than half full and,
when you union them together, get a new Bloom that is over capacity and
not reliable!</p>

<h4 id="loglog-counters">LogLog Counters</h4>
<p>LogLog counters, particularly HyperLogLog++, offer the best efficiency
when counting the size of a set or taking the union of sets. They don’t,
however, do well at intersections. They can be useful, for example, when
counting unique users by geography and allowing for accumulations based
on different geographic combinations. In general, LogLog-type algorithms
are very versatile, and there are even adaptations that can temporally
window your data.</p>
<p>LogLog-type counters
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup>
are based on the realization that the individual bits of a hash
function can also be considered to be random. That is to say, the
probability of the first bit of a hash being <span
class="monospaced">1</span> is 50%, the probability of the first two
bits being <span class="monospaced">01</span> is 25%, and the
probability of the first three bits being <span
class="monospaced">001</span> is 12.5%. Knowing these probabilities, and
keeping the hash with the most 0s at the beginning (i.e., the least
probable hash value), we can come up with an estimate of how many items
we’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>A good analogy for this method is flipping coins. Imagine we would like
to flip a coin 32 times and get heads every time. The number 32 comes
from the fact that we are using 32-bit hash functions. If we flip the
coin once and it comes up tails, then we will store the number <span
class="monospaced">0</span>, since our best attempt yielded 0 heads in a
row. Since we know the probabilities behind this coin flip, we can also
tell you that our longest series was <span class="monospaced">0</span>
long and you can estimate that we’ve tried this experiment <span
class="monospaced">2^0 = 1</span> time. If we keep flipping the coin and
we’re able to get 10 heads before getting a tail, then we would store
the number <span class="monospaced">10</span>. Using the same logic, you
could estimate that we’ve tried the experiment <span
class="monospaced">2^10 = 1024</span> times. With this system, the
highest we could count would be the maximum number of flips we consider
(for 32 flips, this is <span class="monospaced">2^32 =
4,294,967,296</span>).</p>
<p>In order to encode this logic with LogLog-type counters, we take the
binary representation of the hash value of our input and see how many
<span class="monospaced">0</span> s there are before we see our first
<span class="monospaced">1</span>. The hash value can be thought of as a
series of 32 coin flips, where <span class="monospaced">0</span> means a
flip for heads and <span class="monospaced">1</span> means a flip for
tails (i.e., <span class="monospaced">000010101101</span> means we
flipped 4 heads before our first tails and <span
class="monospaced">010101101</span> means we flipped 1 head before
flipping our first tail). This gives us an idea of how many attempts
happened before this hash value was gotten. The mathematics behind this
system are almost equivalent to those of the Morris counter, with one
major exception: the “random” values are acquired by looking at the
actual input instead of using a random number generator. This means that
if we keep adding the same value to a LogLog counter its internal state
will not change.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The biggest drawback of this method is that we may get a hash value that
increases the counter right at the beginning and skews our estimates.
This would be similar to flipping 32 tails on the first try. In order to
remedy this, we should have many people flipping coins at the same time
and combine their results. The law of large numbers tells us that as we
add more and more flippers, the total statistics become less affected by
anomalous samples from individual flippers. The exact way that we
combine the results is the root of the difference between LogLog-type
methods (classic LogLog, SuperLogLog, HyperLogLog, HyperLogLog++, etc.).</p>
<p>This “multiple flipper” method can be accomplished by taking the first
couple of bits of a hash value and using that to designate which of our
flippers had that particular result. If we take the first 4 bits of the
hash, this means we have <span class="monospaced">2^4 = 16</span>
flippers. Since we used the first 4 bits for this selection, we only
have 28 bits left (corresponding to 28 individual coin flips per coin
flipper), meaning each counter can only count up to <span
class="monospaced">2^28 = 268,435,456</span>. In addition, there is a
constant (alpha) that depends on the number of flippers there are, which
normalizes the estimation.
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup>
All of this together gives us an algorithm with \( \frac{1.05}{\sqrt{m}} \)
accuracy, where <em>m</em> is the number of registers (or flippers) used.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>In the <span class="monospaced">__len__</span> method, we are
averaging the estimates from all of the individual LogLog registers.
This, however, is not the most efficient way to combine the data! This
is because we may get some unfortunate hash values that make one
particular register spike up while the others are still at low values.
Because of this, we are only able to achieve an error rate of \( O ( \frac{1.30}{\sqrt{m}} ) \),
where <em>m</em> is the number of registers used.</p>
<p>SuperLogLog
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup>
was devised as a fix to this problem. With this algorithm, only
the lowest 70% of the registers were used for the size estimate, and
their value was limited by a maximum value given by a restriction rule.
This addition decreased the error rate to \( O(\frac{1.05}{\sqrt{m}}) \). This
was counterintuitive, since we got a better estimate by disregarding
information!</p>
<p>Finally, HyperLogLog
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup>
came out in 2007 and gave us further accuracy gains. This was
done simply by changing the method of averaging the individual
registers: instead of simply averaging, we use a spherical averaging
scheme
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup>
that also has special considerations for different edge cases
the structure could be in. This brings us to the current best error rate
of \( O(\frac{1.04}{\sqrt{m}}) \). In addition, this formulation removes a
sorting operation that is necessary with SuperLogLog. This can greatly
speed up the performance of the data structure when trying to insert
items at a high volume.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The only further increase in accuracy was given by the HyperLogLog++
algorithm, which increased the accuracy of the data structure while it
is relatively empty. When more items are inserted, this scheme reverts
to standard HyperLogLog. This is actually quite useful, since the
statistics of the LogLog-type counters require a lot of data to be
accurate — having a scheme for allowing better accuracy with fewer items
greatly improves the usability of this method. This extra accuracy is
achieved by having a smaller but more accurate HyperLogLog structure
that can be later converted into the larger structure that was
originally requested. Also, there are some imperially derived constants
that are used in the size estimates that remove biases.</p>
<h4 id="composite-structures">Composite Structures</h4>
<p>It is important to note that the above structures are simply the
building blocks for more complicated algorithms and methods. We can put
these tools together in different ways in order to achieve various
results.</p>
<p>For example, one common problem we chose to solve in the prototype was
identifying which of several thousand phrases occurs within a given
piece of text. To make matters worse, this calculation needed to happen
very quickly, since we were parsing many messages per second.</p>
<p>The resulting solution was a hierarchy of Bloom filters arranged in such
a way as to efficiently implement a Rabin–Karp string search algorithm.
This gave us the low memory use of a Bloom filter and the efficiency of
an optimized string searching algorithm. In the end, we were able to
search through 1,000 words for one of 16,000 variable-length keywords in
under a millisecond on commodity hardware.</p>

feed these keys into the data structures we’ve just looked at and
periodically query, “How many unique entries have there been?”</p>
<p>Probabilistic data structures are about guarantees — once you know the
questions you’re asking and the computational constraints, you can pick
the structure that makes the right guarantees for your situation.</p>

<p>We can see that the data structures that contain more stateful variables
(such as HyperLogLog and K-Min Values) do better, since they more
robustly handle bad statistics. On the other hand, the Morris counter
and the single LogLog register can quickly have very high error rates if
one unfortunate random number or hash value occurs. For most of the
algorithms, however, we know that the number of stateful variables is
directly correlated with the error guarantees, so this makes sense.</p>
<p>Looking just at the probabilistic data structures that have the best
performance (and really, the ones you will probably use), we can
summarize their utility and their approximate memory usage (see
<a href="#example-11.-comparison-of-major-probabilistic-data-structures"
class="doc_link">Example 11. Comparison of major probabilistic data structures</a>). We can see a huge change in
memory usage depending on the questions we care to ask. This simply
highlights the fact that when using a probabilistic data structure, you
must first consider what questions you really need to answer about the
dataset before proceeding. Also note that only the Bloom filter’s size
depends on the number of elements. The HyperLogLog and K-Min Values’s
sizes are <em>only</em> dependent on the error rate.</p>

<p>The major takeaway from this experiment is that if you are able to
specialize your code, you can get amazing speed and memory gains.
Probabilistic data structures are an algorithmic way of specializing
your code. We store only the data we need in order to answer specific
questions with given error bounds. By only having to deal with a subset
of the information given, not only can we make the memory footprint much
smaller, but we can also perform most operations over the structure
faster (as can be seen with the insertion time into the datrie in
<a href="#example-12.-size-estimates-for-the-number-of-unique-words-in-wikipedia"
class="doc_link">Example 12. Size estimates for the number of unique words in Wikipedia</a> being larger than with
any of the probabilistic data structures).</p>
<p>As a result, whether or not you use probabilistic data structures, you
should always keep in mind what questions you are going to be asking of
your data and how you can most effectively store that data in order to
ask those specialized questions. This may come down to using one
particular type of list over another, using one particular type of
database index over another, or maybe even using a probabilistic data
structure to throw out all but the relevant data!</p>

<h2 id="cliquestream%3A-prototype">CliqueStream: Prototype</h2>
<p>The major proliferation of social networks into our communities offers a
fantastic opportunity to study the ways in which people interact on a
large scale. However, doing so can be quite a computational
challenge — many things on the social web are constantly in flux, and
there is always new data to consider. In addition, the calculations we
wish to perform can often be computationally intensive, to the point
where we can no longer easily incorporate all of the newest information
into our results. This is what makes analyzing social networks a perfect
application for streaming algorithms.</p>
<p>In our prototype, CliqueStream, we wished to create a connected graph
including subreddits and Twitter hashtags where the connections are
formed by the similarities in the rhetoric used. Furthermore, we wished
to be able to identify trends for specific keywords and the similarities
between users interacting in these various groups.</p>
<p>This prototype presents a realtime visualization of the relationships
between billions of words being used on two major social networks,
reddit and Twitter. It allows us to explore current language use and to
understand how people are discussing and interacting with new ideas, and
the relationships between those ideas. This prototype is both a showcase
for the probabilistic methods discussed in this report and a novel
visualization of a fascinating data set.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/15.png" alt="The Cliquestream prototype"><figcaption>The Cliquestream prototype</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-1.-the-cliquestream-prototype">Figure 1. The Cliquestream prototype</h5>
<p>All of these calculations can be quite taxing — analyzing the similarity
of word use between 50 subreddits can easily result in trillions of
comparisons, depending on the number of words used in each one. A
classic algorithm for comparing the similarity between two sets results
in (N) operations, where <span class="monospaced">N</span> is the number
of items the larger of the two sets (this is assuming the data was
heavily preprocessed and sorted). If each of the 50 subreddits used
1,000,000 words, then creating this graph would take more than
1,225,000,000 operations! Even if every operation happened in 0.5
microseconds, this would still amount to 10.2 minutes of computation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we used a probabilistic data structure (such as a
K-Min Values structure with 1.75% error), we could reduce the number of
operations to 2,508,800. This would represent 1.25 seconds of work, as
compared to 10.2 minutes for the classical computation. The ability to
do this calculation quickly allows us to create an informative and
interactive frontend where users can play with data and get results
immediately. As a result, instead of us pre-describing what we want our
users to see, they can form their own complicated queries and see the
results right away.</p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the power of responsive data analysis. If an analyst
must wait a 10 minutes for a result instead of seconds, there’s a
psychological cost to the context switch that slows down the human part
of the creative data analysis process.</p>
<p>Probabilistic algorithms sped up our analysis by 490x, making it
possible for results to be computed in real time.</p>
<p>In addition to the savings in computation, writing our algorithms
probabilistically gave us an enormous savings in memory used. As
described in <a href="#algorithms" class="doc_link">algorithms</a>,
analyzing data probabilistically allows us to store only a small
synopsis of the data as opposed to the full dataset. This is
particularly useful when dealing with a stream of data, where storing
the full dataset would constantly require more and more storage space.
Our probabilistic implementation has bounded memory use — once enough
subreddit and hashtag data comes in to fill the data structures with the
minimum amount of data necessary (see
<a href="#things-to-consider" class="doc_link">Things to Consider</a> for more discussion),
the memory use stabilizes. In the case of our prototype this
stabilization happens at 296.3 MB of memory and 147 MB of storage
(including data snapshots for reloading the in-memory data). This is
quite amazing considering we are ingesting data at a rate of 1.59 Mb/s
(with a modest 40 messages per second) and see a gigabyte of data every
hour and a half!</p>
<p>The ability to bound our memory use and our computational complexity
also saves us maintenance time and decreases system complexity. Our
prototype easily runs on any standard laptop, yet it delivers the kind
of results that are generally associated with a cluster solution
(Hadoop, for example) that requires extraordinary computing power and
significant manpower to maintain.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>An important aspect when designing a good data analysis pipeline with
streams is to decouple as many of the components from each other as
possible. That is to say, the various elements should communicate
through a simple API and not be dependent on their particular
implementation. This is a strong principle of modern system architecture
and is particularly relevant for stream-based systems.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/16.svg" alt="Data analysis pipeline"><figcaption>Data analysis pipeline</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-2.-general-streaming-data-analysis-pipeline">Figure 2. General streaming data analysis pipeline</h5>
<p>This decoupling is beneficial because it allows developers to work
concurrently without affecting each other’s systems. In addition, if the
interface is sufficiently general (for example, using an HTTP-based
API), then individual developers can use any language in order to
implement a particular segment of the overall system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, scaling becomes much easier when the components are
modular. If we start by running the entire system on one server and soon
realize we need more computing power or better fault tolerance, we can
move <em>some</em> of the system to new servers that can function as backup
systems or provide additional computational capacity.</p>
<p>In general, the components of a data processing pipeline involve
gathering the data, moving the data to the right places, analyzing it,
and providing a method to gather the results. In classic batch
infrastructures (such as Hadoop), the results are provided in a text
file that contains the output of the analysis. For a streaming
architecture, we need a way to query the system whenever we want to see
what the current state of the calculation is. To accommodate this, we
chose to create a REST API such that any external system can issue
queries to the system and see what the current results are.
Alternatively, some analysis schemes can provide new, modified versions,
of the original data stream for other processes to take advantage of.
Generally this is used to either filter the stream (by removing
non-pertinent messages) or to augment it (by adding new fields).</p>
<p>For example, in
<a href="#figure-2.-general-streaming-data-analysis-pipeline" class="doc_link">Figure 2. General streaming data analysis pipeline</a> the <span
class="monospaced">cat_extractor</span> analysis routine finds tweets
relating to cats and filters them into their own stream (named the <span
class="monospaced">cat_stream</span>). Any other analysis routine can
now read this filtered stream and do further analysis to it (such at the
<span class="monospaced">all_cat_tweets</span> routine).</p>

<h4 id="collection-and-analysis-pipeline">Collection and Analysis Pipeline</h4>
<p>The first hurdle when working with streaming data is setting up an
infrastructure that can route messages to the correct place. This can be
made even more challenging when dealing with multiple sources of data,
some of which support streaming and some of which require polling.</p>
<p>For the prototype, we identified two main data sources of interest:
reddit and Twitter. The Twitter API supports streaming results. For
this, we regularly check which hashtags are currently trending and set
up a stream of tweets that mention these entities. This provides our
backend with a constant supply of data to parse.</p>
<p>Reddit, on the other hand, requires that our backend go and fetch new
data at regular intervals. This was set up as an asynchronous process
that gets new data and fills a buffer with it. Once the buffer is full,
we can process this data.</p>
<p>For this particular prototype, we chose to have the code generating the
data speak directly to the analysis plugins. However, for more
complicated situations (e.g., when multiple different systems need
access to the same stream of data), a messaging protocol should be used.
NSQ <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup>
is a simple solution that does just that — data can be published
to different topics and consumers can subscribe to those topics in order
to read the stream. These sorts of systems also help deal with fault
tolerance by having guarantees on the delivery of each message.
Furthermore, they allow for easy scaling of a system by decoupling
systems from each other (see “NSQ for Robust Production Clustering” in
Chapter 10 of <em>High Performance Python</em> for a more in-depth discussion).</p>
<p>As data is coming in, we queue it into small batches. This idea of
mini-batches (approximately 50-100 messages per batch) is incredibly
important when doing performance analysis. While our algorithms are
online and can handle one piece of data at a time, we can greatly
optimize the I/O performance by handling small batches. It is quite
important to tune any I/O, whether it is an API request or a database
operation or simply updating an in-memory data structure, such that the
overhead of initializing such an operation is offset by the amount of
work that is actually done (see Chapter 8 of <em>High Performance Python</em>
for a more in-depth treatment of this issue).</p>
<p>An example of using mini-batches is with making API requests through an
HTTP interface. If we were requesting data for 50 different users, we
could either initiate 50 different requests or use an endpoint that can
satisfy all requests for us at once. While the total amount of data
being transferred back and forth is the same, we expect the batched
request to complete faster since we only need to initiate one HTTP
connection. This speedup is most evident when the time to transfer the
actual response data becomes comparable to the time to initialize a
connection.</p>
<p>The batches of data are sent to a collection of processing plugins.
These plugins do a variety of things, from maintaining the probabilistic
data structures to checking the health of the system. The only
requirement is that the plugin inherits from the <span
class="monospaced">PluginBase</span> object to ensure we can properly
maintain the state and integrity of the pipeline.</p>
<pre><code>class PluginBase(object):
    def save(self, location):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        Save the current state of the plugin to the directory location
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        logger.info(&quot;Save not implemented&quot;)

    def load(self, location):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        Load state from directory location or raise exception
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        logger.info(&quot;Load not implemented&quot;)

    def __call__(self, messages):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        Process messages in the messages list. Raise exception on fatal error
        that should stop processing.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        logger.info(&quot;Call not implemented&quot;)

    def routes(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        Return description of the HTTP routes in order to get plugin state. For
        example, we could return the following list of tuples to register
        &quot;plugin/get&quot; and &quot;plugin/status&quot;:
            [
                ('/plugin/get'    , GetHandler)    ,
                ('/plugin/status' , StatusHandler) ,
            ]
        The handler objects should inherit from tornado.web.BaseHandler.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        logger.info(&quot;Routes not implemented&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>These plugins are all responsible for their own external APIs (as
defined by their <span class="monospaced">routes</span> functionality).
Therefore, each plugin can register as many interfaces into its state as
are necessary. This allows us to create multiple routes for each plugin
in order to get different insights into the analyses they are
performing. For example, our plugin that handles tracking the words used
in a subreddit/hashtag registers one route to find the number of unique
words used in that community and another route to compare the similarity
of multiple communities.</p>
<h4 id="comparing-words">Comparing Words</h4>
<p>To calculate the similarity between word choices, we used a K-Min Values
data structure with <span class="monospaced">k</span> set to <span
class="monospaced">1024</span> (see
<a href="#kminvalues" class="doc_link">kminvalues</a>). This choice was
made because this structure can efficiently calculate the Jaccard
distance between two sets, which encodes how similar they are normalized
by how big they are. This is the perfect score for quantifying how much
two subreddits or hashtags share word usage while normalizing for
particularly verbose communities.</p>
<p>The implementation was done in GoLang and is called <span
class="monospaced">gocountme</span> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup>
it provides a simple HTTP interface to manipulate probabilistic
sets. This allows us to very simply add elements to a collection and
then do various set operations on them. For example, we can easily add
all users of a website and compare them in a language-agnostic way.</p>
<pre><code>$ for user in $( cat site_A_users.txt ); do
    curl &quot;http://gocountme/add?key=siteA&amp;value=${user}&quot;;
done;

$ for user in $( cat site_B_users.txt ); do
    curl &quot;http://gocountme/add?key=siteB&amp;value=${user}&quot;;
done;

$ curl &quot;http://gocountme/cardinality?key=siteA&quot;
{
  &quot;status_code&quot;: 200,
  &quot;status_txt&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;data&quot;: 9943.261918592398 # Actual cardinality is 10,000 (an error of 0.56%)
}

$ curl &quot;http://gocountme/correlation?key=siteA&amp;key=siteB&quot;
{
  &quot;status_code&quot;: 200,
  &quot;status_txt&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;data&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;keys&quot;: [
        &quot;siteA&quot;,
        &quot;siteB&quot;
      ],
      &quot;jaccard&quot;: 0.234375 # Actual Jaccard distance is 0.2305 (an error of 1.65%)
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>This system was engineered to optimize for throughput and availability
by using Google’s <span class="monospaced">leveldb</span> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup>
library. In addition, it supports writing customized queries
through a simple querying language in order to build up complicated
statements that can easily be evaluated server-side.</p>
<p>Lastly, we can examine the actual state of the internal K-Min Values
structure. This allows us to easily accumulate data from multiple <span
class="monospaced">gocountme</span> instances and perform calculations
on them — so, we can have small <span
class="monospaced">gocountme</span> instances on many computers in order
to maintain local statistics with the ability to accumulate the states
to gather insights into global statistics.</p>
<h4 id="keyword-usage">Keyword Usage</h4>
<p>Keyword monitoring requires solving two problems: first we must be able
to efficiently extract valuable keywords from a given text, and then we
must be able to maintain relevant statistics for them. Extracting
keywords can quickly become a difficult problem as the number of
keywords being tracked increases. Likewise, maintaining statistics for
that set can become difficult as we start wanting to store statistics
for hundreds of thousands of items.</p>
<p>In order to extract the keywords from a text, we use the hierarchical
Bloom filter described in
<a href="#composite-structures" class="doc_link">Composite Structures</a>. This allows us to
find any of 10,000 keywords using only 56.7 KB of memory. Simply storing
the keywords in a hash table for lookup would require 2192.8 KB;
however, considerably more space would be required to efficiently search
for the keywords within a text, since a lot of preprocessing must be
done. Furthermore, the Bloom filter’s memory use is agnostic to the
actual size of the keywords and only scales with the number of them.</p>
<p>Once we have extracted the keyword data, we insert an association of
subreddit/hashtag to keyword into a system called <em>forgettable</em>.
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup>
At first look, forgettable seems to simply be a database for
categorical distributions — it can store the counts and probabilities of
keyword mentions for each subreddit or hashtag. However, it uses a
scheme borrowed from radioactive decay using Poisson processes in order
to discard old data and slowly “forget” old statistics.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/17.svg" alt="Expiring data"><figcaption>Expiring data</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-3.-different-results-with-different-data-expiration-policies">Figure 3. Different results with different data expiration policies</h5>
<p>The ability to forget old data in this way gives us many advantages.
Firstly, we can bound the size of the database so that we aren’t
constantly required to upgrade the server’s capacity. Also, we are able
to discard old data without having to store information regarding when
the data first came in or having discontinuities in our data as a result
of data expiration policies.</p>
<p>Storing timestamps for when data was inserted can be quite a burden on a
data store. In fact, storing data insertion times for the purpose of
deleting old data can easily grow the size of your data by many orders
of magnitude. In addition to the extra storage comes the extra
computation necessary to sift through the metadata in order to find the
correct elements to delete. This method has also been implemented in the
past by inserting data into a queue (thus avoiding the need to store
additional timestamps); however, this organization of the data greatly
reduces the speed of the system by forcing a complete recalculation of
results at every query.</p>
<p>Alternatively, another common scheme for forgetting data is to “expire”
it (i.e., delete it from the database completely after a certain
period). However, this causes problems with the statistics: old data
does not fade away into the background, but rather <em>all</em> the data simply
disappears after a certain time, causing discontinuities in any insights
given from the data.</p>
<p>With the forgettable approach, not only are we able to maintain smooth
statistics on our data, but we are also able to reasonably say that the
statistics provided favor recent data. One of the major advantages is
that as trends of usage change, so will the distribution that we are
storing. As a result, we can more easily identify what the current state
of a distribution is. This translates, in our prototype, to being able
to easily talk about the <em>recent</em> importance of a particular keyword in
a community. Below we see a direct call to the <span
class="monospaced">forgettable</span> API requesting the top 5
subreddits and hashtags that have recently mentioned the word “whiskey”.
In addition to the direct counts in each of these groups, we see the
proportion relative to all mentions of the word (for example, the
subreddit “bourbon” accounts for 10.5% of all mentions of “whiskey”).</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>Using probabilistic methods, we are able to efficiently process large
amounts of subreddit and Twitter trending topic data. Of course, with
great amounts of data comes the responsibility to display it without
completely overwhelming the viewer. After examining several methods of
representation, we decided to use the JavaScript library D3.js
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup>
to create an interactive, force-directed graph that modeled the
subreddits and trending topics as nodes linked to each other by word use
similarity.</p>
<h4 id="visualizing-similarity">Visualizing Similarity</h4>
<p>Displaying similarity relationships between multiple objects can be
tricky. To get a truly comprehensive view of the relationships between
the 40 nodes we display by default in the prototype, we would need
40-dimensional vision. We may someday get to that point (cybernetic
implants?), but for now we’re forced to embed those relationships in the
two dimensions of a computer screen.
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup></p>

<h5 id="figure-4.-subreddit-word-use-similarity-visualized-using-an-adjacency-matrix">Figure 4. Subreddit word use similarity visualized using an adjacency matrix</h5>
<p>One of the most comprehensive methods of display is the adjacency
matrix.
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">[37]</a></sup>
This method satisfies the condition of showing the relationship
of each node to every other one, but it does so at the cost of easy or
intuitive decipherability.</p>

<p>A force-directed graph displays the same information, but it uses
humankind’s inherent understanding of physical forces to build a more
intuitive model of relationships.
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">[38]</a></sup>
The D3.js force-directed layout includes a simplified but robust
set of simulated forces based on charged particles and springs. Nodes
are pulled toward each other by links according to the strength of their
relationship. At the same time, nodes repel one another by a set force
(otherwise, the result would be a clump of nodes stacked on top of each
other — not a particularly useful visualization). The final
visualization is a result of these forces settling into an equilibrium.</p>

<p>Force-directed graphs carry their own disadvantages, however. Plugging
our data directly into the visualization without any adjustments
resulted in a “hairball” effect, in which the number of crossed links
overwhelmed any ability to discern meaningful relationships. We first
attempted to control the hairballness by creating a link value
threshold, removing links whose similarity values were below a certain
number. This helped, but because of the variation in size between the
subreddits we were examining, the global threshold created a technically
correct but ultimately uninformative split between the top and bottom
ends of the subreddit size spectrum, where the top nodes still
hairballed and the bottom nodes were set adrift.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/21.png" alt="Subreddit word use similarity visualized using a force-directed graphwith a global link threshold"><figcaption>Subreddit word use similarity visualized using a force-directed graph
with a global link threshold</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-7.-subreddit-word-use-similarity-visualized-using-a-force-directed-graph-with-a-global-link-threshold">Figure 7. Subreddit word use similarity visualized using a force-directed graph with a global link threshold</h5>
<p>What we really needed was a localized threshold, which highlighted each
particular node’s strongest links. After a bit of exploration, we
settled on the following code, which ensures that each node’s two
strongest links are on the graph.</p>
<h5 id="example-1.-localized-threshold-for-links">Example 1. Localized threshold for links</h5>
<pre><code>// Sort all links from server by strength
raw_links.sort(compareJaccard);
// Loop through those links
for (var i=0; i&lt;raw_links.length; i++) {
  var link = raw_links[i];
  // Get source and target nodes from link
  var source_node = link.source_node;
  var target_node = link.target_node;
  // Set link limit per node
  var limit = 2;
  // If either the source node OR the target node has less than the link limit, then add the link to the graph. This means that each node will have at least the link limit, and many will have more.
  if (source_node.related_nodes.length &lt; limit || target_node.related_nodes.length &lt; limit) {
    source_node.related_nodes.push(link);
    target_node.related_nodes.push(link);
    links.push(link);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because one node’s strongest link could be another’s fifth-strongest,
this does not mean each node has <em>only</em> two links, but rather guarantees
that each one meets that minimum. We found that this filter, by
significantly trimming down the hairball, did a much better job of
making the significant links visible and the overall network structure
understandable. The type of filter you may want to apply depends, like
your data structure, on what questions you are interested in.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/22.png" alt="Force-directed graph, with the filter applied"><figcaption>Force-directed graph, with the filter applied</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-8.-force-directed-graph%2C-with-the-filter-applied">Figure 8. Force-directed graph, with the filter applied</h5>
<p>Even with the filter applied, the graph of keyword similarity is still a
lot of information to take in. Fortunately, since we are working in an
interactive medium, we can let the user clarify their picture of the
data through exploration. Using conventions from other visualizations,
such as the pan and zoom of Google Maps, makes this process feel
intuitive and approachable. In our prototype, hovering over a node
highlights its connections while fading the rest of the graph into the
background. Clicking on that node pins it to the center and reveals
additional information.</p>

<h5 id="figure-9.-force-directed-graph%2C-node-detail">Figure 9. Force-directed graph, node detail</h5>
<p>Allowing the user to move through different levels of detail and
abstraction helps make the large amount of data in CliqueStream
digestible. As our ability to analyze huge amounts of data increases, we
must make sure to place an equal focus on making that analysis
understandable. Visualizations like force-directed layouts can be a
great aid in this process, provided we use them thoughtfully and always
as a means to communicate specific information.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-consider">Things to Consider</h3>
<p>There are many lessons to be learned when creating a streaming data
infrastructure and analysis routines. Making mistakes with the initial
setup can negatively impact the adoption of these systems if there is a
steep learning curve, or create many hidden costs if the infrastructure
is inefficient. However, when properly created, an easy data
infrastructure can make prototyping new projects and accessing necessary
data incredibly easy and reduce the possible complexity (and cost) of
the resulting systems.</p>
<p>Special care must also be taken when implementing a streaming analysis
application. Streaming data consumers are different from other analysis
applications in that they do not stop — as opposed to batch analysis
programs that run over a given chunk of data and then stop, streaming
programs should be able to keep running as long as there is data to be
processed. As a result, special care must be given to architecting in
these solutions and understanding how they will operate over time.</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-industry">State of the Industry</h2>
<p>There’s been significant growth in recent years in the number of
software systems available for working with streaming data, both in the
open source and commercial markets. In this section, we review the
options currently available for working with data streams, with a focus
on implementations of probabilistic algorithms.</p>
<p>Realistically, however, we have found that while there are commodity
systems for working with streams of data, very few are designed for
probabilistic modeling. Most existing systems are designed to feed
realtime data into a traditional SQL database or data warehouse.</p>
<p>Also, the vocabulary commonly used in the market is still evolving. You
may see streaming systems referred to as “event processing systems,” or
“complex event processing” or even “event correlation” systems. We are
starting to see the rich history of legacy event processing systems
collide with the modern reality of commoditized Hadoop and other
map-reduce infrastructures.</p>
<p>It’s an exciting time for streaming infrastructure, as these tools are
beginning to hit maturity and become stable platforms.</p>
<h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3>
<p>Much of the impressive development of streaming infrastructure has come
from the open source community. There are several projects that are
commonly found in production on “web-scale” products. On the business
side, several of these projects have large commercial efforts behind
them and are great options for enterprise systems.</p>
<p>A product is considered to be “web scale” when it must manage data from
very large numbers of Internet users or web pages. The obvious examples
are Google and Facebook, but there are many smaller companies that have
built impressive infrastructures for managing data.</p>
<p>We have chosen to write about only those open source projects that are
proven to work well in production for large-scale systems, and that
offer value for probabilistic algorithms. This list is by no means
exhaustive; keep in mind also that this is a rapidly evolving field.</p>
<h4 id="apache-storm">Apache Storm</h4>
<p>Storm is designed to do for realtime stream processing what Hadoop did
for batch processing — that is, create a stable and robust commodity
open source solution for a problem area that usually requires messy and
complex homebrewed architecture, or very expensive proprietary software.</p>
<p>Storm originated at BackType, a startup founded in 2008 with a focus on
providing analytics for businesses across social and web platforms. Work
on Storm began in 2010, and the system was open-sourced after Twitter
acquired BackType in 2011. It became an official Apache project in 2013.</p>
<p>Practically, Storm is considered by many engineers to be a heavyweight
solution. It must also be deployed alongside other infrastructure (Storm
only provides the stream management system), so it is not, by itself, a
complete solution.</p>
<p>Storm famously powers Twitter’s realtime analytics,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">[39]</a></sup>
and YieldBot has used Storm, alongside Apache Kafka (a
distributed messaging system) and Apache Cassandra (a distributed
database), for probabilistic ranking and trend analysis.</p>
<h4 id="nsq-and-messaging-protocols">NSQ and Messaging Protocols</h4>
<p>NSQ is a realtime distributed messaging platform that is horizontally
scalable and handles high-throughput streams. NSQ is written in Go, a
programming language created by Google with strong support for
concurrency that is starting to be adopted by many distributed system
engineers.</p>
<p>NSQ was developed in 2012 at bitly, a social media analytics company, to
handle a messaging architecture that powers many downstream services
with varying requirements. It is now running in production at many
companies, including Stripe, BuzzFeed, Digg, and Hailo.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/25.svg" alt="NSQ System Architecture"><figcaption>NSQ System Architecture</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-1.-nsq-system-architecture">Figure 1. NSQ System Architecture</h5>
<p>We include NSQ in this review because it is an excellent package for
handling incoming data streams that feed into probabilistic systems.</p>
<h4 id="streamtools">Streamtools</h4>
<p>Streamtools<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">[40]</a></sup>
is a graphical tool for visually working with streams of data.
It was developed in 2013 by the New York Times R&amp;D Lab with the goal of
enabling developers to easily work with streams of data.</p>
<p>Streamtools offers a visual vocabulary of operations that can be applied
to realtime streams of data without programming. It’s significant
because it democratizes the ability to work with realtime streams,
vastly increasing the number of people in a typical organization who can
create products or find insights on the available data.</p>
<h4 id="rethinkdb">RethinkDB</h4>
<p>RethinkDB<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">[41]</a></sup>
is an emerging project we find fascinating enough to include in
this report. It’s an open source distributed database with a built-in
administrative interface and intuitive query language.</p>
<p>The RethinkDB team recently added a streaming API that supports working
with, querying, and storing realtime streams of data. This feature
allows application developers to invert the typical model of
development, so that rather than constantly polling a datastore, they
can subscribe to database updates and have RethinkDB push those updates
into the application. This can be a strong advantage for applications
built on realtime data.</p>
<h3 id="commercial-vendors">Commercial Vendors</h3>
<p>Commercial complex event processing systems have been in the market
since the 1990s, and all major database vendors offer a streaming data
processing solution. These solutions are available at high cost (typical
pricing is approximately US$40,000 annually) and are generally only a
recommended option if you already run data solutions from a particular
vendor in your environment.</p>
<p>The largest difference between the open source options in this space and
the commercial ones is the developer experience. All of the commercial
options have a recommended or required Integrated Development
Environment (IDE). This simplifies the process of integrating streaming
analytics into an existing infrastrcture, but forces compliance to a
specific metaphor of data flow design.</p>
<p>Few of the provided components use probabilistic models, though
implementation is straightforward with any of them.</p>
<p>In this section, we give a brief overview of some of the dominant
commercial solutions.</p>
<h4 id="sap-event-stream-processor-(esp)">SAP Event Stream Processor (ESP)</h4>
<p>The SAP ESP solution includes an Integrated Development Environment
(IDE) with a graphical interface to visually connect and program the
data sources and outputs. It supports visual analytics, allowing for
both realtime and batch analytics to be designed in the same dashboard
view.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/26.png" alt="SAP ESP"><figcaption>SAP ESP</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-2.-a-screenshot-of-the-sap-esp-analytics-design-view">Figure 2. A screenshot of the SAP ESP analytics design view</h5>
<h4 id="ibm-infosphere-streams">IBM InfoSphere Streams</h4>
<p>IBM’s offering retails at $43,700.00 for a production annual license. It
also offers a graphical view of how data flows through the application
(one of their training manuals insists this is the “natural way to view
an application”), and allows programmers to use various analysis
metaphors for working with and analyzing their data.</p>
<p>Many applications of IBM’s offering are found in the finance industry.</p>
<h4 id="oracle-event-processing">Oracle Event Processing</h4>
<p>Oracle’s Event Processing solution is a stand-alone stream processor
that also integrates with Oracle’s suite of solutions. It offers a
visual data flow editor in the IDE, as well as a web view.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>Probabilistic methods are putting our current algorithms in a new
light — rather than constantly trying to improve their speed by adding
more computing power, we can simply allow for a bounded amount of error
and get immense gains. This will allow us to move our analyses from the
large computing clusters in which they currently reside into the hands
of individuals.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/28.svg" alt="The future"><figcaption>The future</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-1.-faster-and-lower-resource-analysis-will-bring-complex-computation-to-user-devices">Figure 1. Faster and lower resource analysis will bring complex computation to user devices</h5>
<p>One potentially very exciting application would be the ability to take
in all the sensor data we can get hold of and do very cheap calculations
with that data. For example, a fitness tracker could record all
available data and provide the user with insights into that data on the
device, without the need for a cloud-backed cluster. This is in stark
comparison to current approaches, where data is heavily truncated before
being sent to a centralized server in the cloud for processing and
analysis. The move toward fog computing, where processing, storage, and
analysis are done on consumer devices closer to the network edge brings
analysis and insights closer to where they should be — with the people
asking the questions — so the information is in the right place at the
right time. In addition, since the data being analyzed is hashed, the
original information is lost and the users can rest assured that their
information remains private.</p>
<p>Another point of interest is the ability of these algorithms to deal
with changes in the underlying dataset. This is incredibly important as
we collect more data, but still care about actionable information that
relies on what is happening <em>right now</em>. Incoming data may change
completely, and we can accommodate this by using time-windowed versions
of the algorithms or, if the change is fundamental to the data type, a
change in hash function. Windowed algorithms are not only beneficial in
allowing us to bound resource usage, but also provide enhanced
understanding of the data by “forgetting” older information and always
providing us with the most recent insights.</p>
<p>This ability to window data and, in general, to be able to peek inside
of the data structure’s internal state at any point to get the current
results is incredibly important in today’s dynamic world. Getting
results too late or ones that potentially incorporate data that is of no
use anymore lessens the potential impact our results can make. For
example, if we were analyzing traffic patterns on our website in
relation to changes we have made to content (through A/B testing, or if
new content has recently been made available), we would want to know
immediately what effect the changes have made. Knowing that most of the
readers of the new content also liked another piece of content, or are
also users of a particular site feature, or how they compare to other
users is extremely actionable information that can be used to greatly
enhance user participation and the user experience. Furthermore, in a
world where the vast majority of interaction with a new piece of content
happens in the first 15 minutes,
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">[42]</a></sup>
we do not have time to do anything but a very fast realtime
analysis — by the time a batch analysis is done it is already too late!</p>
<p>Finally, probabilistic streaming methods provide a cultural paradigm
shift for data analysts. Currently, their job is over once they have an
algorithm that is able to output the analysis that they wanted. These
methods, however, show themselves as the additional step of cementing
the insights they learned in their exploration into systems to make
people smarter by answering their questions as they are being asked.</p>
<h3 id="ethics">Ethics</h3>
<p>One major advantage of probabilistic methods is that they discard the
original data in favor of an internal summary (also known as a “sketch”
of the original data, or a “synopsis”). This summarization is generally
created using a one-way hashing function that makes it almost impossible
to reproduce the original data. As a result, almost perfect privacy
regarding the original data is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Data breaches are becoming more and more common. Howev- er, if
aggregated hashed data is stolen, it’s not currently possi- ble to
reverse engineer the source data from the values stored by probabilistic
systems (and it’s unlikely to ever be possible with any sort of
precision).</p>
<p>For example, we can create a graph that compares cookies of people who
go to various websites. We can easily determine how similar the
audiences of various websites are, and even analyze the paths by which
users navigate through the various resources. However, we cannot give an
enumerated list of the cookies that are following these trends (only
information regarding how many of them each website has seen, how many
are shared between sites, and how many are different). This is the holy
grail of bulk analysis — while we can still perform the analysis we
require and give in-depth insights regarding user patterns, we cannot
identify the users, and we maintain their privacy. This is particularly
important when dealing with medical or student data, where laws mandate
a level of privacy that often makes analysis more cumbersome.</p>
<figure><img src="figures/29.svg" alt="Probabilistic data structures offer inherit privacy while stillallowing for interesting insights in the aggregate"><figcaption>Probabilistic data structures offer inherit privacy while still
allowing for interesting insights in the aggregate</figcaption></figure>
<h5 id="figure-2.-probabilistic-data-structures-offer-inherit-privacy-while-still-allowing-for-interesting-insights-in-the-aggregate">Figure 2. Probabilistic data structures offer inherit privacy while still allowing for interesting insights in the aggregate</h5>
<p>This added anonymity is not only important for the trust of users but it
is also becoming more and more legally required as more and more nations
legislate for personal data privacy. In the European Union, the Data
Protection Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation limit
what sort of personally identifiable information may be collected, how
it can be used, and how it can cross borders. This has become such a
problem that new datacenters are being created in Lithuania, simply as a
place within EU borders to perform user analysis. Similarly, in the US
user data is protected under HIPAA and various state laws. This has also
led to special datacenters (most notably the Amazon AWS HIPAA-compliant
servers) specifically designed to easily create a space for compliant
analysis.</p>
<p>As a result, there is a fantastic compromise between the needs of
service users and organizations interested in deriving insights. Users
can provide completely anonymized data with mathematical assurances that
their original data cannot be recovered. However, the organizations are
still able to derive insights that they are interested in by using the
appropriate probabilistic algorithms.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Probabilistic methods give us the ability to perform calculations faster
and with fewer resources than previously possible. As large-volume data
streams become more ubiquitous, being able to do complex calculations
quickly will become increasingly important. With data collection rates
continuing to increase, the calculation methods we are currently
comfortable with will begin to require overwhelming computational
resources. These techniques also open up new potential analysis and
product opportunities.</p>
<p>In this report we’ve explored the methods and advances in the field of
probabilistic algorithms in order to outline how powerful these
algorithms are and how critical they will be in shaping the future of
computing. We explained probabilistic algorithms, gave historical
context, and provided examples of many common applications which can
easily be shaped by these methods, including realtime trend analysis on
social networks (as illustrated by our prototype, CliqueStream) and
anomaly detection in security.</p>
<p>With the prototype we show the simplification of a complex problem with
probabilistic methods. While it was once simply unfeasible to do a
similarity graph with the massive dataset containing every word used on
Reddit and Twitter, probabilistic algorithms make it possible to do the
calculations in realtime using modest computers. In fact, the initial
view of the prototype performs a probabilistic calculation in seconds,
while it would have taken over 15 minutes to do the equivalent
calculation with classical deterministic algorithms. This is a simple
demonstration of the power of this approach to working with realtime
data.</p>
<p>In addition to allowing us to do classical computations on smaller
hardware, the computational edge afforded by probabilistic methods will
allow us to change the ways which users interact with algorithms. Since
calculations can be done on commodity hardware, even on cell phones, we
can bring the algorithms to users and help them get the insights they
need immediately and without being tied to a cumbersome cloud
architecture. This not only saves on the computational requirements
needed for a given service, affords users the privacy that they desire,
and opens up new opportunities to create businesses and services that
push computation onto the devices themselves.</p>

<h5 id="figure-1.-probabilistic-methods-will-allow-personal-devices-to-be-less-reliant-on-cloud-architecture">Figure 1. Probabilistic methods will allow personal devices to be less reliant on cloud architecture</h5>
<p>We remain excited about these types of probabilistic systems. There are
many applications where these methods can be plugged in today with
immediate returns, and even more where they enable novel architectures,
allowing for new types of applications. Understanding these methods will
unlock new possible insights, turn decision making into a quicker and
more data-driven process, and enable new kinds of products to be built.</p>
