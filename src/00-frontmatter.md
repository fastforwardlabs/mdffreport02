_This is an applied research report by [Cloudera Fast Forward](https://www.cloudera.com/products/fast-forward-labs-research.html).
We write reports about emerging technologies, and conduct experiments to explore what's possible.
Read our full report about Probabilistic Methods for Realtime Streams below, or <a href="/FF02-Probabilistic Methods for Realtime Streams.pdf" target="_blank" id="report-pdf-download">download the PDF</a>.
The prototype for our report on Probabilistic Methods for Realtime Streams is called CliqueStream.
The prototype allows one to visualize the process of summarization over different types of documents.
[We hope you enjoy exploring it]()._
